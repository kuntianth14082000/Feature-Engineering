Step by step feature Engineering

1.differentiate b/t numeric and labeled features
2.first handle numeric data	Microai@1234 kuntinathnoraje@gmail.com
	a]fill nan values
		random sampling
		mean/median/mode
		capture nan with new feature
		End of distribution
		Arbitary value imputation
	b]Check for Outliers
		Guassian Distribution
		IQR
		BOXCOX
	c]Feature scaling 
		1.Standardisation and Normalization
		2.scaling to minimum and maximum
		3.Scaling to median and Quantile
		4.Guassian transformation	(check distribution of the data)
			  log transformation
			  Resiprocal transformation
			  Square_root transformation
			  BoxCox transformation

		feature scaling is required for only some of the ML models
		and for all Deep learning models
		

3.Handle categorical data
	a]Fill nan labels
		most Frequent labels
		Adding a variable to capture nan
	b]handle categorical features(Encoding)
		i]nominal data
			OneHotEncoding
			OneHotEncoding with many features(top-10 labels)
			mean Encoding
		ii]ordinal data
			Label Encoding
			Target Guided ordinal encoding
		Count or Frequency Encoding
		Probability ratio Encoding

4.check for imbalanced dataset
	if dataset is imbalanced:-
		i]Under sampling
		ii]over sampling
		iii]SMOTE technique
		iv]Ensemble technique
		v]Random forest classifier technique
